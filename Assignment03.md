# Assigment 3

Due: 6 December 2018

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese characters and pinyin). Please hand in your homework before class on the due date. Submissions should be in PDF format and sent by email to peng@pku.edu.cn. You must submit your work in English (this doesn’t need to be flawless, as long as we can understand what you mean).

1a. The best calibrations of the Fundamental Plane for nearby elliptical galaxies have a typical scatter of ~0.12 mag in absolute B magnitude (and, hence, in the distance modulus, since the errors in the measured apparent magnitudes are negligible by comparison). How large a distance uncertainty does this scatter imply? Justify your assumptions.

1b. Suppose that galaxies have random peculiar motions of order 600 km s–1 relative to the large-scale Hubble flow, but that you did not know this fact and so were computing distances using the simple Hubble expansion formula, D = v/H0. As a consequence, the random velocities would
introduce an error, δD, that is a function of distance. For H0 = 70 km s–1 Mpc–1, at what distance D0 does the effect of peculiar motions become
smaller than the uncertainty in the expected Hubble Flow velocity you would derive by employing the Fundamental Plane relation to estimate distances? Express your answer in physical terms (in Mpc) and determine the corresponding distance modulus.

1c. Bright elliptical galaxies have a typical absolute magnitude of MB≈−22 mag. What is the apparent B magnitude of a galaxy at D0?

1d. Turning the problem around, suppose that you can conduct a galaxy survey that is complete down to B = 18.5 mag. For elliptical galaxies with MB ≈ −22 mag, to what distance (in Mpc) can you still measure these
galaxies (for the same limiting signal-to-noise ratio)? How large a peculiar velocity do they need to have to introduce a distance uncertainty (for distances based on assuming a pure Hubble Flow) comparable to that of the uncertainty in the Fundamental Plane distance estimate?


2. To give you a feeling for the problems associated with using galaxies that are not distant enough to be in the Hubble flow for deriving H0, download a slice of the “Virgo consortium universe” from the class website: http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/~peng/teaching/distances18/VCUslice.dat. These data come from a massive simulation of a cube of the Universe measuring 150 Mpc on a side. The data give the x, y, and z coordinates (in Mpc) of each galaxy in the simulation, their line-of-sight velocity (in km/s), and their star-formation rate (in Msun/yr). The slice has been taken by restricting the x coordinates of the galaxies, so plot y versus z to see the large-scale structure in the simulation slice.
Assume that the Sun is at the coordinate (50,0,0) and calculate the inferred Hubble constant from each of the following samples:
a. Galaxies closer than 20 Mpc from the Sun;
b. Galaxies between 25 and 75 Mpc from the Sun; and
c. Galaxies further than 100 Mpc from the Sun.
To do this, use the known distance of the galaxies (calculated from the coordinates) and the line-of-sight velocities. What do you estimate for the value of the Hubble constant used to produce the simulation (include an error bar!)?
Comment on the accuracy of using the two relatively nearby samples: what kind of uncertainty do the peculiar velocities of galaxies add?
Now repeat this using only elliptical galaxies (star-formation rate = 0). Are your results different? Why?
