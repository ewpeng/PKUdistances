# Introduction to Distance Measurement in Astronomy

**Course:** Distance Measurement in Astronomy - Fall, 2020

**Instructor:** Prof. [Eric Peng 彭逸西](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/~peng) <peng@pku.edu.cn>

**Course Description**


This course is aimed at the first-year graduate student in astronomy, or advanced undergraduate astronomy majors. The goal of this class is for students to understand the critical role that distance measurement has played in astronomy and astrophysics, and to be familiar with modern techniques and data. By the end of the class, the student will understand how the measurement of astronomical distances fits into a number of frontier research areas, such as cosmology, stellar evolution, and galaxy evolution.

This class is structured around lectures and student assignments. It is not the goal of this class to expose students to every topic in the field, but rather to explore a few important concepts, and to encourage students to explore associated material. The working languages of this class are English and Python.

**Prerequisites**


   * This course does not assume any prior astronomy coursework, but those with no astronomy background will be expected to acquire quickly the relevant terminology used in astronomy and astrophysics.

   * Basic computer programming and plotting skills. Previous knowledge of Python is not required, but all work will be done in Python. To learn some relevant Python, a few useful web sites include: [Python for Astronomers](https://python4astronomers.github.io), [AstroPython](http://www.astropython.org/), and [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/).

**Course Overview**

This course will explore the observational and theoretical underpinnings of our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. We will explore the following concepts:

1. Introduction
    * The 3D Universe on large(r) scales

    * Stellar populations
    * Photometric evolution
4. From the Milky Way to the Local Group: Applications. I.
