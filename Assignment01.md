1. The distance from the Earth to the Sun sets the absolute scale for all distances measured using trigonometric parallax. This is why measuring this distance was a critical scientific problem in the 18th and 19th centuries. One of the first international scientific experiments was an attempt to measure this distance using the transit of Venus. Draw a diagram and describe in words how one could use multiple timing measurements of the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun to estimate the Earth-Sun distance.

2. Today, best measurements of the AU come from using radar to directly measure the distance to Venus as a function of time. Please explain using a diagram and words how one could measure the AU using this method.
