# Assigment 1

Due: 15 November 2018

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese characters and pinyin). Please hand in your homework before class on the due date. Submissions should be in PDF format and sent by email to peng@pku.edu.cn. You must submit your work in English (this doesnâ€™t need to be flawless, as long as we can understand what you mean).

Complete Question 2 and choose one of the remaining three questions to hand in.

1. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;L&space;=&space;4\pi&space;R^2\sigma_B&space;T^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;L&space;=&space;4\pi&space;R^2\sigma_B&space;T^4" title="L = 4\pi R^2\sigma_B T^4" /></a>, where R is the object's radius, T its effective temperature, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\sigma_B" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\sigma_B" title="\sigma_B" /></a> the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The effective temperature can be determined from Wien's Law and the stellar spectrum. If the star is pulsating, with characteristic velocity v and period 2P, show that the minimum radius of the star can be determined by 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" title="10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R+vP)^2 T_1^4 = r^2T_2^4" /></a>
where everything but R can be determined observationally. Why, and how, can this be used to measure the distance to a pulsating star?
