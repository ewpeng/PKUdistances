# Assigment 1

Due: 15 November 2018

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese characters and pinyin). Please hand in your homework before class on the due date. Submissions should be in PDF format and sent by email to peng@pku.edu.cn. You must submit your work in English (this doesn’t need to be flawless, as long as we can understand what you mean).

Complete Question 2 and choose one of the remaining three questions to hand in.

1. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;L&space;=&space;4\pi&space;R^2\sigma_B&space;T^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;L&space;=&space;4\pi&space;R^2\sigma_B&space;T^4" title="L = 4\pi R^2\sigma_B T^4" /></a>, where R is the object's radius, T its effective temperature, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\sigma_B" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\sigma_B" title="\sigma_B" /></a> the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The effective temperature can be determined from Wien's Law and the stellar spectrum. If the star is pulsating, with characteristic velocity *v* and period *2P*, show that the minimum radius of the star can be determined by 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" title="10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R+vP)^2 T_1^4 = r^2T_2^4" /></a>, where everything but *R* can be determined observationally. Why, and **how**, can this be used to measure the distance to a pulsating star?

2. Examine the ASCII file [SeboLMC.dat](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/~peng/teaching/distances18/SeboLMC.dat). This file contains a table of data from Sebo et al. (2002, ApJS, 142, 71) for 605 Cepheid variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). You can use these data to re-derive the famous Cepheid Period–Luminosity Relation (PLR, or Leavitt Law) pioneered by Henrietta Leavitt about 100 years ago.
Because of the PLR, Cepheid variable stars can be used as standard candles, enabling distance measurements to nearby galaxies. Suppose that you don’t know the distance to the LMC, but assume that it is sufficiently distant that all of its member stars are at the same distance. Then the apparent V magnitude should exhibit the same PLR as the absolute magnitude, but offset by the distance modulus to the LMC, (m – M)<sub>V</sub>. Assume that the relation between period *P* and apparent magnitude *V* is of the form
