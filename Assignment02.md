# Assigment 2

Due: 31 October 2019

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese characters and pinyin). Please hand in your homework before class on the due date. Submissions should be in PDF format and sent by email to peng@pku.edu.cn. You must submit your work in English (this doesn’t need to be flawless, as long as we can understand what you mean).

1. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=L=4\pi&space;R^2&space;\sigma_B&space;T^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L=4\pi&space;R^2&space;\sigma_B&space;T^4" title="L=4\pi R^2 \sigma_B T^4" /></a>, where R is the object's radius, T its effective temperature, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\sigma_B" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\sigma_B" title="\sigma_B" /></a> the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The effective temperature can be determined from Wien's Law and the stellar spectrum. If the star is pulsating, with characteristic velocity *v* and period *2P*, show that the minimum radius of the star can be determined by
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R&plus;vP)^2&space;T_1^4&space;=&space;r^2T_2^4" title="10^{0.4(m_1-m_2)}(R+vP)^2 T_1^4 = r^2T_2^4" /></a>, where everything but *R* can be determined observationally. Why, and **how**, can this be used to measure the distance to a pulsating star?

2. Examine the ASCII file [SeboLMC.dat](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/~peng/teaching/distances19/SeboLMC.dat). This file contains a table of data from Sebo et al. (2002, ApJS, 142, 71) for 605 Cepheid variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). You can use these data to re-derive the famous Cepheid Period–Luminosity Relation (PLR, or Leavitt Law) pioneered by Henrietta Leavitt about 100 years ago.
Because of the PLR, Cepheid variable stars can be used as standard candles, enabling distance measurements to nearby galaxies. Suppose that you don’t know the distance to the LMC, but assume that it is sufficiently distant that all of its member stars are at the same distance. Then the apparent *V* magnitude should exhibit the same PLR as the absolute magnitude, but offset by the distance modulus to the LMC, *(m – M)<sub>V</sub>*. Assume that the relation between period *P* and apparent magnitude *V* is of the form <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=V&space;=&space;c_1{\rm&space;log}P&space;&plus;&space;c_2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V&space;=&space;c_1{\rm&space;log}P&space;&plus;&space;c_2" title="V = c_1{\rm log}P + c_2" /></a> or <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=y&space;=&space;c_1x&space;&plus;&space;c_2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;c_1x&space;&plus;&space;c_2" title="y = c_1x + c_2" /></a>, with *x = log P* and *y = V*.

   a. Make a plot of *V* (on the y-axis) versus log *P*. Be sure to plot *V* with brightness increasing upwards! Now make an educated guess for what you think would be reasonable values of c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>, assuming a linear fit, based on your by-eye estimate of the plot's slope and *y* intercept.

   b. Next, find c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> using the least-squares method as follows. The residuals to the fit are defined as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex={r_i}&space;=&space;{y_i-y_i^\prime}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{r_i}&space;=&space;{y_i-y_i^\prime}" title="{r_i} = {y_i-y_i^\prime}" /></a>, where y<sub>i</sub>' is the fitted value of y at x=x<sub>i</sub> and *i=*[1:*n*] with *n* = number of data points. Run a grid search yourself to find the parameters with the smallest chi-square, where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\chi^2&space;=&space;\sum_i(\frac{r_i}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2&space;=&space;\sum_i(\frac{y_i-y_i^\prime}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\chi^2&space;=&space;\sum_i(\frac{r_i}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2&space;=&space;\sum_i(\frac{y_i-y_i^\prime}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2" title="\chi^2 = \sum_i(\frac{r_i}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2 = \sum_i(\frac{y_i-y_i^\prime}{\sigma_{y,i}})^2" /></a>. Assume <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sigma_{y,i}&space;=&space;0.2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma_{y,i}&space;=&space;0.2" title="\sigma_{y,i} = 0.2" /></a> mag for all values of *y*.

   Use a computer to help you do the following:

      (i) Calculate chi-square explicitly (using the equation given above) for any comibination of c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> you input manually. Use trial and error with at leats 10 different parameter choices for each coefficient to find their best fitting values, i.e., the values that minimize chi-squared. Include a plot of *x = log P* and *y = V* showing your best fit.

      (ii) For your fit, plot the residuals r<sub>i</sub> versus log *P*. Discuss the trends (if any) seen in the residuals plot. Does it look like a scatter plot, or are there systematic bumps and wiggles that could be fitted adequately with a higher-order polynomial function?

   c. We will now calibrate and apply the PLR. Suppose you find a Cepheid variable star with a period of *P* = 39.81 +/- 0.01 days and an apparent magnitude of *V* = 7.29 +/- 0.1 mag in the nearby globular cluster 47 Tuc, whose distance you know from main-sequence fitting, i.e., *D* = 4.15 +/- 0.07 kpc. (i) Calculate the distance modulus to 47 Tuc, and then the absolyte magnitude, *M<sub>V</sub>* of the Cepheid variable you have discovered. (ii) Use this *M<sub>V</sub>* and the period *P* for this single star, combined with the best-fiting PLR coefficients you derived above, to calculate the distance modulus to the LMC, as well as its distance in kiloparsecs (kpc). (iii) How does your value compare with the current consensus value in the literature? Are the consistent within the uncertainties you estimated?
